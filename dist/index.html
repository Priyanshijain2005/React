HMR (hot module reloading)
and hmr is doing by parcel ---- hmr means when we some change in our code and save it then it we auto matically run live server is doing this 
ab hmr ko kaise pata chalega ki hamne file mein kuch changes kiye hai
to wo use pata chalega file watcher algorithms it is written in c++

dist keep file to minify our code
production build using build command <npx parcel build index.html>
parcel can be build https on my dov (local server) using command npx parcel index.html --https     

we should put the parcel in gitignore why???

<!--emmet, how to manipulate dom using javascript, shortest program of react, differ- react and react dom
-> react is a global variable which come from a injected javascript files 
->react.createElemet has three atribute - first is tag, second is props(html attribute-- class , id,color,etc) and third is chidren of react element(object)

->render will modify the dom and what will happen so that it does not append while it overwrite 

    ->order of script tag is very important
    ->react element is an object 
   
   
 --save dev and -D both are same both meaning is dev dependecy when we install the parcel in our program we use this like npm install --save dev parcel
   ->dev dependency means all the pakages that my project needs
   IN PACKAGE.JSON FILE-
   "devDependencies": {
     "parcel": "^2.13.3"
    }
  -> we need parcel in my development environment
  -> and there is a ^ symbol known as caret
  -> we also use ~ tilde in the place of ^
  -> if we don't use ~ tilde and ^ then that means it is the exact version
  -> caret means if in the market after some time new version of parcel is appeared then it will automatically   upgrade our project (minor and patch both are upgrade).
   but if the tilde sign we use then it will also upgrade it but only patch is upgrade 

  -> dependency means my project depends upon packages and why i need packages because it provide various of functionalities to my react app 
  -> only react app not the full production app we need to minify it , need to bundler ,need to clearance ,need to do treeshaking
  -> those packages will be install to our project using npm that is a package manager

  -> for dont want the uncertainity on my local machine and my production, so we have the pacakage lock that locks the version
  -> this integrity hash ensures that what exactly the parsal version running in my system is exactly the same on my production or not it maintain the integrity because it is a hash

  -> node modules is database of your npm

  *our app has dependencies on parsal and parsal have also some dependencies like as bundler(for minify the code)
  -> so we dont put it node modules into our git , it is very heavier thing , because we have an package lock json file /*and pacakge json*/ that have all the suffient information that help i can recreate the node modules
-> to install the react using the cdn files is not the good approach because the cdn hai react 18 version what if the version is change in the fuure then we had to again copy the cdn file and paste over it and also it has some unpkg.com files that is not contain our node modules and others so now

-> npm install react 
-> npm i react-dom also use npm install react-dom(i is the shortcut for the install)

->npx means execute using npm
npx parcel index.html (here index.html is the entry point for parcel)
